## About The Project

For our final research project in COGS 108: Data Science in Practice, my team and I studied how specific sociodemographic factors can affect the quality of a romantic relationship, specifically focusing on age, income, and education differences between partners. We used data from the survey, "How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST)" that was conducted by a group from Stanford in 2017 to investigate how Americans meet their spouses and romantic partners, which included details on relationship dynamics and quality, and sociodemographic variables. Our hypothesis was that the greater the difference in age, income, and education, the lower the relationship quality as this implies more conflicting expectations of one another regarding priorities in lifestyles and career goals, affecting overall relationship compatibility. To analyze this, we used varying plotting methods and the Chi-Square test.
