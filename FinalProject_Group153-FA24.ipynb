    "This study investigates how mismatches in sociodemographic factors—age gaps over five years, differences in household income, and education level differences—affect the quality of committed romantic relationships among adults in the United States. Our research question asks whether these mismatches negatively impact relationship quality. Using a cleaned dataset of 2,825 responses from the “How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017” survey, we conducted an analysis of the correlations between these sociodemographic gaps and self-reported relationship quality. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed that larger age and education differences were associated with poorer relationship quality, while household income gaps appeared less impactful.\n",
    "The Chi-squared tests confirmed significant associations between relationship quality and age differences as well as education level mismatches, with p-values < 0.05. These findings support the hypothesis that greater sociodemographic mismatches correlate with lower relationship quality. However, income disparities may play a more nuanced role influenced by unmeasured variables.\n",
    "The findings highlight the complex interplay of sociodemographic variables in shaping the dynamics of romantic relationships. While age and education mismatches may strain relationship quality, income disparities seem less critical. These results have implications for understanding relationship dynamics and addressing societal biases, but we acknowledge the potential for misinterpretation and emphasize the need to approach such findings within an ethical framework."

    "There are many factors that can influence the quality of a relationship. Although some may seem arbitrary, there is a general idea that certain mismatches in compatibility tend to result in lower quality relationships. Sociodemographic factors such as age, economic status, race, education level, and even previous relationship histories play a role in shaping the interactions and compatibility of individuals within a relationship. \n",

    "A study was done by Li et al., examining the effects on a womens happiness in relation to her education compared to her husband. The data looked at a wide variety of sociodemographic variables, specifically looking at education and self esteem. The results showed a mean of -0.167 for education, referring to the fact that only 22% of women had a higher education than their counterparts.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Additionally, in comparison there is a decrease in a woman's happiness from 0.064 to 0.058 as she increases in education. The study suggests that there is a possible correlation between happiness in a relationship and the education level of both partners. The clear sign of either partner “marrying up” can release negative emotions to the relationship. Despite this, the study does not specify the effect of education on the relationship itself, which is a point to consider. \n",

    "According to The Guardian, significant income or wealth gaps in relationships can create unique challenges, often increasing power dynamics that can influence relationship stability and satisfaction. Such differences may highlight contrasting financial habits or values, potentially leading to tensions around shared expenses, lifestyle choices, or long-term goals. Studies indicate that individuals who maintain financial independence within relationships may experience less pressure tied to monetary support, but they still often face societal judgments about income disparity, especially when gender norms are challenged.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "Previous studies and articles have mentioned many of these sociodemographic factors, but not particularly in terms of how it affects the stability or length of the relationship itself.

    "We hypothesize that the greater the mismatch in sociodemographic variables, such as large age gaps, income disparities, and differences in education levels, the greater the decline of quality in committed romantic relationships. This prediction is based on the idea that these mismatches lead to conflicting expectations for each other (i.e. partners with age gaps greater than 5 years are likely to be in different stages of life, which means difference in priorities regarding lifestyles and career goals), affecting compatibility and overall relationship satisfaction. Thus, a negative association can be inferred between the sociodemographic variables and relationship quality."

    "Dataset #1 contains information about 3510 survey respondents and their romantic partners detailing aspects of their relationship in 2017, all compiled into a single excel file. Some important variables to note include respondent and partner ages to assist in measuring age gaps, and respondent and partner education levels scaled from 1 (No formal education) to 4 (Professional or Doctorate degree) to compare education level differences; both age and education differences were calculated and added as their separate columns in the subset dataframe. Averages for both gaps in age and education were also generated to encompass overall observations on relationship quality. Responses regarding which individual in the relationship earned more serve as a way to study household income gaps, where the values in this column are reformatted to determine whether a gap exists or not, and relationship quality scaled from 1 (Excellent) to 5 (Very Poor) will be the primary outcome variable explored across the described sociodemographic variables. This dataset was preprocessed using .read_excel(), wrangled for relevant variables into a subset dataframe, and cleaned with both .isnull() and .dropna() to filter out missing values or responses."

    "When studying sensitive topics such as romantic relationships, it is vital to acknowledge that the implications of our findings could influence and bias certain behaviors. For that, it is important to approach our project with an ethical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we had to identify any potential biases in our population. Ensuring the data is clean first will assist in any unintended bias. We concluded that the factor of anonymity helped to ensure that the method of survey was through random-digit dial phone calls. This allows for a more holistic representation of the standard American society we aim for since surveys won't be directed to one region, but rather across the United States. There are no privacy or terms of use issues with the data we have proposed, but an unlikely, possible issue with anonymization is that unique combinations of sociodemographic data could make participants of the study re-identifiable. Privacy is also enforced within aggregated variables such as household income. While privacy is ensured through anonymization by associating individuals with IDs, there may still be bias present through technology limitations. Groups across the United States that do not have access to telephones may be underrepresented. This could also exclude populations with lower household income or other factors that lead to restricted telephone access.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for potential biases in our dataset(s) and if any groups are underrepresented, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA). During analysis, we will check if there are sociodemographic factors that disproportionately influence our model, indicating any sort of bias. For instance, we will assess the distribution of age differences, education level differences, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings in our research could unintentionally reinforce societal biases and discourage individuals from pursuing non-conventional relationships. For instance, based on our study’s correlations, those in relationships with significant age gaps might perceive their dynamic as judged to be even more unconventional. Another issue that could potentially be problematic is that our findings could be used to promote narrow views on the “ideal” relationship to discourage differences between partners in relationships. Our research only analyzes data for potential correlations, and does not imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these issues, we could make sure variables such as incomes are aggregated rather than exact to protect the privacy of participants even further. We will communicate clearly in our analyses and video presentation that any correlations in our findings do not imply causation or any predictive, causal factors in relationship success or failure. Describing our findings and conclusions as exploratory is significant to avoid any judgemental biases or behaviors that arise. We will also emphasize the importance of diversity in relationships and validate sociodemographic differences to ensure that our findings are not misinterpreted to reinforce stereotypes.\n",
    "By adhering to this ethical framework, the aim of our project is to contribute to discussions of relationship dynamics constructively, while respecting the diversity and complexity of relationships."

    "# Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research project aims to understand how specific sociodemographic factors can affect the quality of a romantic relationship, specifically focusing on age, income, and education differences between partners. The dataset accessed primarily focused on people in the United States and reached out through a phone survey, highlighting a general limitation of our project. However, the provided data still offers valuable insights that can be manipulated and understood for our research question at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EDA process displayed a visual representation of the trend between age gap, income gap, and education gap among respondents quality of relationship. There is a negative association between each variable, where as the gap increases, the relationship quality decreases. Despite the variable distributions skewing heavily towards the right, most maintained a good relationship and a negligible gap in the sociodemographic factors. In contrast, income levels served as the only variable which, by itself presented a greater proportion of respondents who had a gap versus those who did not. When comparing age distribution to relationship quality, gaps bigger than 19 years display a smaller prevalence of an ‘excellent’ relationship. However, some age gap values are severely less common as compared to others, making the distribution of relationship quality a bit skewed (as in some cases, the sample size could be as low as 1 relationship). Similarly, for education level difference, there is a clear skewed distribution of relationship quality, where the positive relationships become less prevalent as the education gap increases. Notably, the data shows little effect or relationship between income gap and relationship quality, suggesting that unlike what we believed to be true, there is likely no effect of an income gap on the quality of one’s relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further data analysis was done to understand if the relationship between these variables were significant. We used a Chi-Square test for each variable relationship (age vs. relationship quality, education level vs. relationship quality, and household income vs. relationship quality). The results showed that each tested sociodemographic variable was associated with relationship quality and had an affect to the quality of respondent’s relationship. Through p-values of 0, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that age, household income, and education level impacts the quality of a relationship. Despite the lack of visual difference for income gap in the EDA analysis, the Chi-Square test shows significant association between the two variables, thus we can say overall there is an impact of income gap on the relationship. Through EDA analysis and the latter statistical testing, we can accept our hypothesis and state that the greater the age gap, education level gap, and income gap between partners, the lower the quality of the relationship is likely to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our analysis provided insight into relationships between sociodemographic gaps and relationship quality, there were limitations such as dataset representation, unexplored confounding variables, and more. The dataset relied on responses surveyed through phone calls, which excluded populations without access to telecommunication, meaning that certain socioeconomic groups such as those residing in rural areas were not considered to their extent. Thus, generalizability of findings could have been limited. These findings are only exploratory and identify possible correlations, not causations. The findings should not be interpreted as predictors of relationship success or failure. Instead, these findings provide us insight into relationship dynamics.\n",
