    "There are many factors that can influence the length of a relationship. Although some may seem arbitrary, there is a general idea that certain mismatches in compatibility tend to result in shorter relationships. Sociodemographic factors such as age, economic status, race, education level, and even previous relationship histories play a role in shaping the interactions and compatibility of individuals within a relationship. \n",

    "Vogue describes a general rule of thumb that the ideal age gap should be half your age then add seven for the lower barrier, and take seven of your age then double it for the upper barrier.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Age is not always a deciding factor that makes or breaks a relationship, but the power dynamic that results can be emotionally taxing. \n",

    "A study was done by Li et al., examining the effects on a womens happiness in relation to her education compared to her husband. The data looked at a wide variety of sociodemographic variables, specifically looking at education and self esteem. The results showed a mean of -0.167 for education, referring to the fact that only 22% of women had a higher education than their counterparts.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Additionally, in comparison there is a decrease in a woman's happiness from 0.064 to 0.058 as she increases in education. The study suggests that there is a possible correlation between happiness in a relationship and the education level of both partners. The clear sign of either partner “marrying up” can release negative emotions to the relationship. Despite this, the study does not specify the effect of education on the relationship itself, which is a point to consider. \n",

    "According to The Guardian, significant income or wealth gaps in relationships can create unique challenges, often increasing power dynamics that can influence relationship stability and satisfaction. Such differences may highlight contrasting financial habits or values, potentially leading to tensions around shared expenses, lifestyle choices, or long-term goals. Studies indicate that individuals who maintain financial independence within relationships may experience less pressure tied to monetary support, but they still often face societal judgments about income disparity, especially when gender norms are challenged.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "Previous studies and articles have mentioned many of these sociodemographic factors, but not particularly in terms of how it affects the stability or length of the relationship itself. This project seeks to explore how these factors interact to predict the length of romantic relationships, providing a quantitative analysis that aims to uncover patterns of relationship longevity across diverse sociodemographic backgrounds.\n",

    "The greater the difference in variables between partners, the greater the likelihood of a relationship not lasting. For example, if there is a larger age gap, we believe that both partners are likely to be in different stages in life. The two individuals would have different expectations from the relationship, and overtime this is bound to impact their long-term compatibility. Hence, by looking at the difference, the greater the mismatch the greater the chances of the relationship not lasting long-term."
