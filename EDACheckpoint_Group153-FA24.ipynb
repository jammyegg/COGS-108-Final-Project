    "There are many factors that can influence the length of a relationship. Although some may seem arbitrary, there is a general idea that certain mismatches in compatibility tend to result in shorter relationships. Sociodemographic factors such as age, economic status, race, education level, and even previous relationship histories play a role in shaping the interactions and compatibility of individuals within a relationship. \n",

    "A study was done by Li et al., examining the effects on a womens happiness in relation to her education compared to her husband. The data looked at a wide variety of sociodemographic variables, specifically looking at education and self esteem. The results showed a mean of -0.167 for education, referring to the fact that only 22% of women had a higher education than their counterparts.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Additionally, in comparison there is a decrease in a woman's happiness from 0.064 to 0.058 as she increases in education. The study suggests that there is a possible correlation between happiness in a relationship and the education level of both partners. The clear sign of either partner “marrying up” can release negative emotions to the relationship. Despite this, the study does not specify the effect of education on the relationship itself, which is a point to consider. \n",

    "According to The Guardian, significant income or wealth gaps in relationships can create unique challenges, often increasing power dynamics that can influence relationship stability and satisfaction. Such differences may highlight contrasting financial habits or values, potentially leading to tensions around shared expenses, lifestyle choices, or long-term goals. Studies indicate that individuals who maintain financial independence within relationships may experience less pressure tied to monetary support, but they still often face societal judgments about income disparity, especially when gender norms are challenged.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "Previous studies and articles have mentioned many of these sociodemographic factors, but not particularly in terms of how it affects the stability or length of the relationship itself. This project seeks to explore how these factors interact to predict the length of romantic relationships, providing a quantitative analysis that aims to uncover patterns of relationship longevity across diverse sociodemographic backgrounds.\n",

Some important variables to note include who earned more between the two individuals, education level and age of the respondents as well as that of their partners, where the former two are categorically encoded as a numerical value and the latter is numerical to accurately depict age. This dataset was originally an Excel, therefore we used .read_excel() to load and read the data file and the .dropna() function to filter out for the ‘w1_q34’ variable, which categorically describes the quality of the relationship and the conclusion we are focusing on. The subset data is renamed as ‘subset_df’ with 2847 variables and no missing values."

    "  There are no biases in the data proposed because the method of survey that is distributed to respondents is through random digit dial phone calls. This allows for a more holistic representation of the standard American society we aim for since surveys won't be directed to one region, but rather across the United States. There are no privacy or terms of use issues with the data we have proposed as well. Each individual is associated with an ID for anonymization.\n",
    "- Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis? (For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?)\n",
    "\n",
    "  It is unlikely that there are any potential biases in our dataset(s) as we intend for it to be composed of a diverse pool of people across the country through randomized voluntary phone call surveys. However, our data excludes particular populations that do not have access to cellular devices or telephones, which could be problematic as it could mean exclusion of populations with lower household income or other reasons for this restricted access.\n",

    "  To check for potential biases in our dataset(s) and if any groups are underrepresented, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA). During analysis, we will check if there are sociodemographic factors that disproportionately influence our model, indicating any sort of bias.\n",
    "- Are there any other issues related to your topic area, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "  A possible issue with anonymization is that unique combinations of sociodemographic data could make participants of the study re-identifiable. The findings in our research could unintentionally reinforce societal biases and discourage individuals from pursuing non-conventional relationships. For instance, based on our study’s correlations, those in relationships with significant age gaps might perceive their dynamic as judged to be even more unconventional. Another issue that could potentially be problematic is that our findings could be used to promote narrow views on the “ideal” relationship to discourage differences between partners in relationships. Our research only analyzes data for potential correlations, and does not imply causation.\n",
    "- How will you handle issues you identified?\n",
    "\n",
    "  To handle these issues, we could make sure variables such as incomes are aggregated rather than exact to protect the privacy of participants even further. We will communicate clearly that any correlations in our findings do not imply causation or any predictive, causal factors in relationship success or failure. We will also emphasize the importance of diversity in relationships and validate sociodemographic differences to ensure that our findings are not misinterpreted to reinforce stereotypes."
